# Theory_of_Algorithms_Projects

## About This Repository 
This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of my Theory of Algorithms course (CSCI 163). Each project focuses on a specific topic within the realm of algorithm analysis and design. The projects cover key areas, such as analysis of nonrecursive and recursive algorithms, dynamic programming, and much more.

## Course Topics Covered
1. Introduction and Asymptotic Notation
2. Analysis of Nonrecursive and Recursive Algorithms
3. Brute Force and Decrease-Conquer
4. Divide and Conquer: Quick Sort, Selection
5. Greedy Algorithms: Minimum Spanning Trees
6. Greedy: Shortest Paths
7. Dynamic Programming: Coin Change, LCS, Shortest Paths
